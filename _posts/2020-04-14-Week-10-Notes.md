These notes are designed to provide a brief overview of the status of the project for both OMAFRA and Code for Canada staffers. Our other blog posts will cover specific project areas in deeper detail.

For context, we are currently working from home due to restrictions placed in place to control COVID-19. This week was shortened by the Easter Holidays. 


# Activities
- Held first Project Panel meeting. The meeting laid out the work we’d done so far in a lot of detail, as well as highlights on our research, and possible solutions. You can download the presentation [here](https://code-for-canada.github.io/omafra-updates/assets/project-panel-2020-04-06.pdf) 
- We’ve completed synthesis of our specialist interviews and will be uploading a summary of our observations
- We continued interviewing Grower Groups last week as indicated in last week’s notes.  The aim of this research is to get a better sense of how growers contribute to the data that OMAFRA staff work with, and how they use the insights generated by OMAFRA


# To-Do
- We’ll be reviewing the Scoutek app, with a view of possibly getting some insights into product decisions that we could use in our solution
- Meet with the RIBS project team to see if there any possible areas of collaboration and/or overlap


# Blockers
- None
