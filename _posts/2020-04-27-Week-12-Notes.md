These notes are designed to provide a brief overview of the status of the project for both OMAFRA and Code for Canada staffers. Our other blog posts will cover specific project areas in deeper detail.

For context, we are currently working from home due to restrictions placed in place to control COVID-19. Unfortunately, we didn’t get the chance to push out Week 11 notes.
