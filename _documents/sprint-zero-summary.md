# Executive Summary

The goals of our Sprint Zero meeting were to align the expectations of our large team of stakeholders and better understand those expectations and the needs of our participants. We approached this by giving an overview of our team and process and running two activities designed to help the participants define the value this project will bring and identify criteria for success.

The stakeholder team participated in a  Value Proposition Canvas, which is designed to align a product or service solution around the needs of the user. Participants identified users’ Jobs, Gains, and Pains through solo reflection and group discussion. This workshop allowed the team to develop an in-depth understanding of the scope of data regularly accessed by users and their motivations in interactions with end-user clients. Pains that were identified by this stakeholder group were a lack of resources and support.

In addition, the stakeholder team identified the criteria involved in determining a Success Spectrum for the project. This process aligns stakeholders’ expectations and defines success on a spectrum from failure to epic success.

Outcomes of this process include a roadmap for success which emphasises planning, relationship building, and product development as key contributors to success. This also allowed our team to identify that important action items for the process were enabling sustainability and staff engagement at every stage.

The results of this meeting will allow the Code for Canada team to effectively prioritize and execute work on this project.

# Code for Canada @ OMAFRA

*Code for Canada is a national nonprofit that connects government innovators with the tech and design community. Our programs enable governments to deliver better digital public services and empower communities to solve civic challenges using technology and design.*

## Code for Canada Programs

## Our Team

We also discussed the [fellowship team at OMAFRA](/omafra-updates/about/#our-team)

## How We Work
The cornerstone of our approach is the concept of agile work. Our interpretation of agile allows teams to respond to challenges faster and adapt their work to a rapidly changing environment. 

{: align="center"}
![The words prioritize, execute, improve with red arrows pointing from one to the other forming a cycle](/omafra-updates/images/prioritize-execute-improve.png){:.float-right width="300"}

Plan the Thing, Do the Thing, Make it Better.<br><br>
Or more simply: Prioritize, Execute, Improve.<br><br>
By working in short intervals of time and following these three steps teams can be sure that they are always working on the most important work at any given time and that as priorities change they can quickly adapt their approach.

## The Process
The fellowship project is divided into four phases. These phases and timelines are always flexible and may change as we learn more about the needs of the team, the challenge scope, and the ministry as an organization.

* ### Onboarding - Month 1
The first month of the project is located in Toronto at the Code for Canada offices with other fellowship teams participating in facilitated workshops designed to prepare the fellows for working with government partners and provide the tools needed to solve a diverse set of unique challenges.

* ### User Research and Prototyping - Months 2 and 3
The following two months are focused on research. This includes technical research, a jurisdiction scan, and organizational research as well as a focus on user research. Over this phase fellows will conduct interviews with crop protection specialists, growers, and industry professionals to identify key pain points and potential avenues for a solution.

* ### Build, Test, Revise, Repeat - Months 4 through 8
The longest phase consists of designing, building, and testing solutions to the problems identified in user research. Fellows will begin by designing and testing a number of different concepts, using the feedback from this testing to improve on successful ideas and solidify the core approach. The goal for this phase is to have a clearly defined product that has been tested and is ready for maintenance and extension work as needed.

* ### Transition and Sustainability - Months 9 and 10
These core principles will inform the project at every stage, and will receive a high priority as this iteration of the project nears its end. This phase will focus on documentation of the product and processes developed during the project as well as preparation for OMAFRA staff for a smooth project handoff. Work during this time will be to ensure that the project owners going forward have the tools, skill sets, and support necessary for the long-term success of the project.

# Sprint Zero Introduction

## What is a Sprint
*A sprint is a short period of time planned to complete a set amount of work*

Most of the technology sector owes its success to the focus put on how we work. By ensuring that our work processes are enabling us to focus on what’s most important we can remove many blockers that inefficient processes can introduce.

The core principle at the heart of most modern work methodologies is the sprint (or an equivalent concept). A sprint is a short iteration of work that helps us prioritize the tasks that must be done by setting a concrete goal and executing on it. Teams then take learnings from the sprint forward to help plan the next sprint, repeated until the end of the project.

A sprint can be visualized as four steps: Sprint Planning where the team sets the goal and plans specific tasks, Daily Work with check-ins to make sure everything’s on track and no one is blocked, Sprint Review where the team demos the work done (either for stakeholders or just internally), and Sprint Retro where the team identifies successes and failures of the sprint and uses them to identify a few key action items to help improve their work and project.

## What is a Sprint Zero
Sprint Zero kicks off a project. Our version of Sprint Zero is used to define success, identify obstacles, and align the expectations of our team and stakeholders. It is typically run before the start of a project, involves a lot of sticky notes, and when run well ensures that we’re all on the same page moving forward.

Our intention is to engage the team and stakeholders in the process, build a better understanding of the project scope, define success and failure, and discover our team’s rhythm.

# Activities
Participants were split into three groups for both activities. Each activity involved a period of solo-reflection for the participants to get their ideas written down followed by a discussion where each group had the opportunity to identify overarching themes that emerged and discuss the ideas their fellow group members had identified. Finally the groups had the opportunity to walk around the room and discuss the work the other groups had done.

## Value Proposition Canvas
*The Value Proposition Canvas is a tool which can help ensure that a product or service is positioned around what the customer values and needs.*

![A circle with three sections that read Jobs, Gains, and Pains. An arrow points from the circle to a square with three sections that read Gain Creators, Pain Relievers, and Products and Services](/omafra-updates/images/value-prop-canvas.png)

In this activity participants were asked to complete the half of the value proposition canvas that identifies user Jobs, Gains, and Pains. This let us see how stakeholder participants conceptualized the work users need to do, the impact that work has, and the challenges that are faced when doing it.

To facilitate this we asked three questions:
* **(Jobs)** What does the user need to do?
* **(Gains)** Why is this important?
* **(Pains)** What makes this hard?

### Key Themes
*For a more in depth analysis of this activity you can read the [full document here](/omafra-updates/documents/sprint-zero-value-prop).*

#### Jobs
*The vast majority of jobs performed by our users involve the collection, documentation, analysis, and sharing of data.*

* Data Collection
* Weather Data
* Data Sharing
* Data Based Decision Making

#### Gains
*Our users’ motivations revolve around being able to do work efficiently and to a high standard of quality, ultimately prioritizing the value they add to taxpayers and the growers they work with.*

* Efficiency
* Data Sharing
* Data Based Decision Making
* Taxpayer Value

#### Pains
*Users’ pains revolve around a lack of resources and organizational support as well as unclear internal communication.*

* Lack of Support
* Lack of Resources
* Unclear Communications

## Success Spectrum
*A Success Spectrum helps teams align expectations for the project and define success and failure in a concrete way on a spectrum instead of a binary pass/fail. This allows us to prioritize work clearly and create a roadmap for achieving success.*

In this activity participants were asked to envision what success and failure might look like for the project as well as to identify potential criteria for those metrics.

### Key Themes
*For a more in depth analysis of this activity you can read the [full document here](/omafra-updates/documents/sprint-zero-success-spectrum).*

#### Failure
*What are the criteria for failure and what might cause it?*

Key failure scenarios identified across all three groups centered around a lack of sustainability for a product solution, a product solution that failed to address underlying challenges, and a lack of buy-in for the project from stakeholders and internal organizations.

**Identified Criteria and Scenarios**
* Red Tape
* Solution Scope
* Product Sustainability
* Stakeholder Buy-in

#### Minimum Viable Success
*What are the minimum criteria for this to be successful?*

Key criteria for minimum viable success were largely centered around a database solution that allowed for easy standardization and management of data. Minimum success also hinged on staff coordination and ease of access.

**Identified Criteria**
* Data Management Solution
* Staff Buy-in

#### Target Success
*If we work well and don’t hit any roadblocks what can we achieve?*

Target success criteria identified a database product solution that centralised data, introduced some basic public facing components, and automated some simple workflows. This product must also be easily extendable to adapt to future needs.

**Identified Criteria**
* Centralised Database
* Sustainability

#### Epic Success
*In a perfect world what would be the outcome?*

Epic success for the project was defined broadly as an extension of the database product features and scope. Key features included automated analysis and visualisation workflows, a public facing dashboard, and real-time prediction capacity. Another key criterion was the internal capacity for software development at the ministry or branch level.

**Identified Criteria**
* Automated Workflows
* Public Data Portal
* Real-time Prediction
* Internal Development Capacity

### Roadmap
*Okay, what does this look like?*

The themes identified above across participant groups give us a pretty good overview of what parts of the project are most important to its success. Using this analysis we can take a fairly informed first stab at a project roadmap as outlined by our participants’ expectations.

# Conclusion
The Value Proposition Canvas the stakeholder participants created outlines the data collection, analysis, and distribution required in the participants wor so as to provide the highest possible value to taxpayers and growers. Challenges in completing this work were identified as a lack of resources and support from management.

The stakeholder participants also defined a project Success Spectrum that identified key success criteria as project sustainability, staff engagement, a clear project scope, and a data management solution.

The stated goals of this Sprint Zero were to align and understand the needs and expectations of a large team of stakeholders. Both were accomplished by facilitating reflection and discussion among our stakeholder participants.

The outcome of this Sprint Zero meeting is a roadmap for the success of this project informed by the motivations of the stakeholder participants. This will allow the Code for Canada fellowship team to effectively prioritize and execute work on the project.
